			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using

				technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the
				structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a
				website's
				behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a

			<h3>Unit Learning Outcomes</h3>
			<p>All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of
				study. These
				inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of
				other skills
				and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course
				addresses the
				Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in
				the process
				referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
				understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is
				carefully
				designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing
				all of
				the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.
				Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate
				Capabilities
				through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.</p>
