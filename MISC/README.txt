Unit Outline SPA Link:


The SPA was created in Notepad++ using html, css and js. The website contains the UNIT OUTLINE of the unit ISYS3004 Business Web and Mobile Technologies.

I had planned to implement a simple webpage with the functionality of changing the themes. So far it has been successful with the correct content, styling, and working button.

I have completed the assignment with the assistance and support from W3School. Most of the help i received was from consulting the W3School website and some videos on youtube.

I completed the assignment within one week and a half. I worked everyday, with the minimum number of hours being around 26 hours.
